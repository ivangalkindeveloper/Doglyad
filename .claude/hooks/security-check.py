"""security-check — a Doglyad guard hook keeping secrets and Xcode noise out of git.

Registered as a PreToolUse hook on Bash in .claude/settings.json. It intercepts
staging and commit commands and blocks them (exit 2) when forbidden files would
end up in the commit (backend secrets, Firebase config, model weights, Xcode state).

Logic:
- commit  → check the already staged files (git diff --cached).
- bulk staging → check every pending change (git status --porcelain)
  that the command is about to stage.
- explicit paths → check the paths named in the staging command itself.

Deletions are not blocked: the point of the hook is to keep a secret out of the
repository, and a deletion does the opposite — it removes one. Paths missing from
the working tree are therefore skipped, and `git diff --cached` is filtered
through `--diff-filter=d`.

Exit 0 — allow. Exit 2 — block, with the reason sent to stderr and to Claude.
Any internal error also exits 0 (fail-open) so normal work is never broken.
