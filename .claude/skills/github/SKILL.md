# Work with Git in Doglyad

Use this as the entry point for repository version-control conventions. This skill does not commit or push; use [git-push](../git-push/SKILL.md) to send changes.

## Repository facts

- Primary branch: `master`. Development happens directly on it unless a branch is explicitly requested.
- Remote: `origin`, GitHub repository `ivangalkindeveloper/Doglyad`.
- Use the `gh` CLI for pull requests, issues, releases, and other GitHub-side operations.

## Read-only commands

```bash
git status
git diff
git diff --staged
git log --oneline -20
git show <hash>
git branch
git rev-parse <ref>
git ls-files
```

## Mutating commands

Use deliberately:

```bash
git add <path>
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
```

Run `git push origin master` only through [git-push](../git-push/SKILL.md).

## Conventions

- Write short English commit subjects in imperative mood, capitalized, with no trailing period.
- When Claude Code authors a commit, append `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Run `make format` before committing.
- Never force-push without explicit permission. For a non-fast-forward rejection, rebase with `git pull --rebase origin master`, resolve conflicts, and retry.

## Protected files

The security hook blocks secrets and generated noise, including:

- `backend/main/secrets/`
- `backend/inference/secrets/`
- `ios/Config/`
- `ios/Firebase/`
- `ios/DoglyadNeuralModel/Resources/`
- `*.xcuserstate` and `xcschememanagement.plist`
- `*.pem`, `*.p8`, `*.p12`, `*.keystore`, `*.jks`, `id_rsa`, `secrets.*`, and `credentials.*`

If one is staged, run `git restore --staged <path>`.

- Build and test: [build-verify](../build-verify/SKILL.md)
